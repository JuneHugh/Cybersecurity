# A Project Introduction

In this activity, I will review the professional statement outline to create a professional statement for inclusion in my cybersecurity portfolio documentation.  
Previously, I explored options for creating and hosting a cybersecurity portfolio.  

A **professional statement** serves as an introduction to employers, briefly describing who I am and what I care about.  
It allows me to showcase my interest in cybersecurity, work experience, knowledge, skills, and achievements.  
As I continue to learn more and refine my understanding of key cybersecurity concepts, I can revisit this professional statement and revise it as needed.  

To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating my portfolio, I will read Create a cybersecurity portfolio.  

I will complete this activity and answer the questions that follow before moving on.  
The next course item will provide me with a completed exemplar to compare to my own work.
